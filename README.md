## Task 3 - # A program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the calculation. ## 

## General Info
* At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even,
* divide by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
* Have the program end if the current value is one.

## Filename - collatz.py

## How to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the calculation.
* Define the collatz function as per the general info.
* Request the user to input the postive integer.
* Once inputted the while loop will calculate based on the number chosen.
* Then when the while loop reaches 1, the program closes.

## Technologies
* Visio

## Commands used

## How to reurn the approximate square root
* Request the user to input the positive float number.
* Create function to ensure a postive float number is chosen at the beginning.
* Create funciton based on Newtons square root method.
* Inside the sqRt function set the float value, with the number of iterations needed to return an approx square root.
* Call the functions in an if statement to print the results or the message to enter a postive number.
